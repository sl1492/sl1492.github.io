### **Length Bias Estimation of Small Businesses Lifetime**  
**_Mathematical Economics Honor Thesis_**  
ðŸ“… *Sept 2022 â€“ Apr 2023*  

- Conducted in-depth analysis of lifetime data for 24 restaurants on Carytown Commercial Street, using advanced statistical techniques to estimate average lifespan while minimizing impacts of length bias and right-censoring.  
- Implemented Kaplan-Meier estimators to account for right-censored data and performed rigorous goodness-of-fit tests.  
- Validated the developed estimator against exponential distribution, revealing accurate lifetime estimates devoid of length bias.

### **Analyzing the Statistical Effectiveness of Diagnostic Tests for COVID-19 Using the ROC Curve**  
**_Summer Research Fellowship_**  
ðŸ“… *May 2022 â€“ Aug 2022*  

- Developed a preliminary ROC curve using patient age as a classification threshold for a COVID hospitalization dataset; achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.81.  
- Built multivariate logistic regression models incorporating age, comorbidities, and vital stats, refining survival outcome prediction with an improved AUC of 0.86.  
- Evaluated sensitivity-specificity trade-offs to inform optimal decision thresholds under medical resource constraints.
