Greetings! I am a Master's student at Cornell University studying applied statistics and data science. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from University of Richmond with a departmental honor in May 2023. My academic journey was focused on a major in Mathematical Economics and a minor in Computer Science, providing me with a robust foundation in quantitative analysis and data science.

My professional pursuits reflect my passion for the dynamic intersection of public health and data science, and their impactful applications in the realm of economics. I am eager to leverage my academic achievements and hands-on experience to make meaningful contributions to projects that bridge the gap between healthcare and cutting-edge data science. Let's connect and explore potential opportunities for collaboration in these exciting domains!
